# FE8CM

//Update 5/27/2020 whatever version this is i don't really care anymore
I haven't touched this in a couple of years, but I found out that something changed in either Windows or Java that prevented the fonts from working.
I've made it so that there's only one jar file, the mini version, and embedded the font into the jar file, so it doesn't need to be installed on the system. This should fix that issue.

I was kind of an idiot when I made this and didn't know how to use github so this repository wasn't actually my working directory, so I've changed that and put the old repository in a separate branch.
Now the repository should be my working directory, and you can just download or clone it because to be honest, I have no idea how to make the jar portable.

Hey there!

This used to be a conversation maker for just Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones.
As of update 1.3, this is now a conversation maker for FE6, FE7, and FE8!
(Thanks to @meme_mother for making this possible)
It's supposed to be based off of the FE: Fates Conversation Maker.
I'm @rasambowl on Twitter, if you have any questions or concerns about this program, contact me there, I'll be happy to answer any of them.

From update 1.2, here is the tutorial on how to import your own characters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJSisIypriM

IMPORTANT CHANGES

-added mini version with smaller resolution

-added font in font files

-added all important FE 6, 7 , and 8 characters

-added ability to import backgrounds 
To do this, put your 240 x 160 picture in the backgrounds folder, then put the picture's filename on a new line in backgrounds.txt in the Data folder, and it should work.

Special Thanks goes to @radspacegal for the idea and both @radspacegal and @rajarajacholanI on twitter for help and testing.

I (@rasambowl) did all programming and added all FE8 characters and backgrounds.

@meme_mother made this update possible by adding all the FE6 and FE7 characters (Seriously, go thank them, I'm so thankful for this)
